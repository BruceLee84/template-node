            New Archaeology A movement that began in America in the
            1960s, aimed at making archaeology more scientific by
            employing empiricist and neo-positivist principles.
            positivism A philosophy that the only authentic knowledge is
            scientific knowledge, and that such knowledge can only come
            from positive affirmation of theories through strict scientific
            method.
            postprocessualism A school of archaeological thought that
            uses critical theory and interpretative methods while cautioning
            against the shortcomings of scientific archaeology.
            processualism A school of archaeological thought that uses
            empiricist theories of knowledge and scientific methods to derive
            testable models of human behavior.</p><hr class="hrline2">

        <small><b><u>Throughout</b></u><br>its 200 years as a recognizable intellectual activity, archaeology has focused on both the
            recovery of ancient objects and explaining what
            precisely those objects mean about the societies that
            produced them. In this sense, ‘explanation’ in archaeology is historically and culturally contingent, and the
            aims and techniques of archaeological explanation
            shift as the epistemological and ontological foundations of the discipline shift. The purpose of this entry
            is to define precisely what explanation in archaeology
            is in contemporary terms.
            Explanation is defined by most dictionaries as ‘the
            act of giving the reason for, the justification of, or the
            cause of phenomena.’ Historically and linguistically,
            the terms explanation and cause are associated with
            scientific approaches in the social, behavioral, and
            natural sciences. Within contemporary archaeology,
            however, there are both scientific and nonscientific
            approaches to studying the past. A proper examination of ‘explanation’ in archaeology therefore
            requires a broadening of the definition of explanation to include any epistemology that gives meaning
            to the past as derived from the material record. This
            entry will therefore be an expansive treatment of
            the topic to cover both nonscientific and scientific
            approaches.</small>

        <div class="lin3">
        <small><b><u>At the beginning of the twenty-first century</u></b><br>we can
            profitably define four broad kinds of archaeological
            research based upon their philosophical foundations
            and the implicit and explicit goals stated by their practitioners. These kinds of archaeology, ranging from
            the least to the most scientific: are (1) critical theory,(2) hermeneutic or interpretative archaeology, (3) historicist archaeology, and (4) scientific archaeology. In
            short, contemporary critical theorists seek to create
            narratives of the past consistent with broad moral
            and political principles and to examine the discipline
            of archaeology itself as a constructed social practice.
            Hermeneutic or interpretative archaeology seeks to
            read multiple meanings into the archaeological record.
            Historicist archaeology seeks to explain the archaeological record of objects and archaeological contexts in
            space and time. Scientific archaeology seeks to subsume the empirical archaeological record into broader
            principles of human behavior. Each of these kinds of
            archaeology begins with different logical principles
            and assumptions. For each kind of archaeology, ‘explanation’ has different meanings, if any meaning at
            all. Even more complex, many archaeologists adopt
            the principles of two or more of these intellectual
            traditions simultaneously as they do their work.</small>

                <small><b><u>Idealist Philosophical Traditions</u></b><br>
                    Critical archaeology Critical theory practitioners
                    stand at the end of one continuum in the philosophy
                    of social science. Generally antagonistic to modern
                    philosophies of science (logical positivism and empiricism), the core goal of critical theory is not to define
                    what is in the archaeological record, but rather define: (1) what the archaeological record ought to
                    teach us about the past and (2) to deconstruct archaeology as a power-infused social activity and rectify
                    what they see as past errors in the way archaeology
                    has been practiced. Critical theorists begin with the
                    assumption that all knowledge is socially constructed,
                    a tradition drawn largely from philosophical idealism. Furthermore, in this tradition, no socially constructed knowledge base is better or worse than any
                    other by any a priori criteria. As such, critical theorists
                    in archaeology seek explanation of the past in terms of
                    their implications for social action in the present.
                    Explanation, or more appropriately stated, providing
                    meaning to the archaeological record and to the act of
                    explanation itself, is subsumed under broad social,
                    political, cultural precepts, and/or moral mandates.</small>
            </div>
            <div class="lin5">
                <small><b><u>Empiricism</u></b><br>the forth, is considered inappropriate
                    for archaeological interpretation. Any scientific epistemology assumes that a real and knowable world
                    exists apart from the human observers – that is,
                    what scientists study is independent of the analytical
                    process and has an independent ontological status
                    with its own a priori properties. Scientific epistemologies assume that data and history are real, and that
                    the process of interpretation, in theory (if not necessarily in practice), can be morally neutral. Scientific
                    philosophies eschew the metaphysical. Extreme logical positivism even denied the existence of abstract
                    truths not verifiable by the human senses, although
                    most archaeological scientists today hold much more
                    moderate views as described below.
                    Archaeologists working in this critical theory tradition would ideally expect the interpretation of those
                    power relationships to contribute to some kind of
                    broader social activity that weakens asymmetrical
                    relationships of power in contemporary society. Ironically, while maintaining a hyper-relativistic stance as
                    an ideal, interpretations of the past that conform to
                    morally sound principles of social justice are usually
                    considered superior to those that are perceived.</small>

                    <small><b><u>Philosophical Positions</u></b><br>Historicist archaeology Historicist archaeology
                        seeks to precisely define objects and events in the
                        archaeological record in space and time. The term
                        ‘historicist’ is used to differentiate this school from
                        ‘historical’ archaeology. The latter is a subdiscipline
                        of archaeology focusing on time periods that have
                        contemporary textual information (see Historical
                        Archaeology: As a Discipline). Historical archaeology can be conducted in any one of the four traditions
                        described here (see Historical Archaeology: Methods). The former, described in this article, refers to a
                        particular approach in archaeology that has its own
                        epistemological principles.For instance, the discovery in 1974 of the tomb of
                        the Chinese Emperor Qin Shihuangdi represents a
                        classic instance of explanation in this tradition. The
                        tomb had been described in texts, the dates were
                        known to the precise year, and the archaeological
                        data confirmed and expanded the empirical knowledge of this important culture. <br><br>
                    <b><u>Analysis</u></b><br>Once artifacts and structures have been excavated, or collected from surface surveys, it is necessary to properly study them. This process is known as post-excavation analysis, and is usually the most time-consuming part of an archaeological investigation. It is not uncommon for final excavation reports for major sites to take years to be published.At a basic level of analysis, artifacts found are cleaned, catalogued and compared to published collections. This comparison process often involves classifying them typologically and identifying other sites with similar artifact assemblages. However, a much more comprehensive range of analytical techniques are available through archaeological science, meaning that artifacts can be dated and their compositions examined. Bones, plants, and pollen collected from a site can all be analyzed using the methods of zooarchaeology, paleoethnobotany, palynology and stable isotopes[67] while any texts can usually be deciphered.
                       These techniques frequently provide information that would not otherwise be known, and therefore they contribute greatly to the understanding of a site.<br><br>
                    <b><u>virtual archaeology</u></b><br>Computer graphics are now used to build virtual 3D models of sites, such as the throne room of an Assyrian palace or ancient Rome.[68] Photogrammetry is also used as an analytical tool, and digital topographical models have been combined with astronomical calculations to verify whether or not certain structures (such as pillars) were aligned with astronomical events such as the sun's position at a solstice.[68] Agent-based modeling and simulation can be used to better understand past social dynamics and outcomes. Data mining can be applied to large bodies of archaeological 'grey literature'.
                    For instance, the discovery in 1974 of the tomb of
                    the Chinese Emperor Qin Shihuangdi represents a
                    classic instance of explanation in this tradition. The

                    <small><b><u>Scientific archaeology</u></b><br>Scientific archaeology accepts many of the principles of historicist archaeology
                        but goes further in that the primary goal is to subsume
                        the archaeological record into broader patterns of
                        human behavior in space and time. Scientific archaeology is viewed by its practitioners as a branch of
                        comparative behavioral and social science. As such,
                        it is most closely associated with ‘explanation’ and
                        ‘causality’, as generally understood in the philosophy
                        of science.
                        Contemporary scientific archaeology is an outgrowth of the New Archaeology popular in the
                        1960s and 1970s. The philosophical standards of
                        this perspective can be found in the book Explanation
                        in Archaeology by P. Watson, S. Le Blanc, and
                        C. Redman (1971). The New Archaeology explicitly
                        borrowed from the logical positivism and extreme
                        empiricism of the Vienna School and its later practitioners. When the critique of logical positivism
                        among philosophers of science in the 1950s and
                        1960s gained ground later in archaeology, the New Archaeology modified its epistemological underpinnings. In particular, modifications by the work of the
                        philosopher Hempel (in particular, the recognition of
                        ‘statistical’ laws) and, to a lesser extent, the influence
                        of Popper, contributed to a reformulation that served
                        as the philosophical basis of the next generation of
                        scientific archaeology that developed out of the New
                        Archaeology<br><br>

                        Eliminating some of the excesses of the extreme
                        empiricism of logical positivism and adopting more
                        ‘elastic’ criteria of verification, scientific archaeology
                        has shifted its focus since the 1980s. It is a safe generalization to say that the New Archaeology was largely
                        associated with Hempelian deductive-nomological
                        explanation, while contemporary scientific archaeology is more associated with Popperian falsification
                        epistemologies and instrumentalist philosophies of
                        science. Instrumentalist assumptions reject the notion
                        that absolute truth can be known and instead rely on
                        ‘best fit’ models.the same way that evolutionary biologists construct
                        generalizing principles to understand the origin and
                        evolution of the world’s plants and animals. Within
                        evolutionary biology, there is a wide range of theoretical approaches.Virtually all contemporary scientific neoevolutionary theory rejects the universalizing and totalizing
                        features of early unilineal or, to a lesser extent theory. </small>

                    <small><b><u>Drones</u></b><br>Archaeologists around the world use drones to speed up survey work and protect sites from squatters, builders and miners. In Peru, small drones helped researchers produce three-dimensional models of Peruvian sites instead of the usual flat maps – and in days and weeks instead of months and years.
                         Drones costing as little as £650 have proven useful. In 2013, drones have flown over at least six Peruvian archaeological sites, including the colonial Andean town Machu Llacta 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) above sea level. The drones continue to have altitude problems in the Andes, leading to plans to make a drone blimp, employing open source software.
                         Jeffrey Quilter, an archaeologist with Harvard University said, "You can go up three metres and photograph a room, 300 metres and photograph a site, or you can go up 3,000 metres and photograph the entire valley."
                         In September 2014 drones weighing about 5 kg (11 lb) were used for 3D mapping of the above-ground ruins of the Greek city of Aphrodisias. The data are being analysed by the Austrian Archaeological Institute in Vienna.

                         In medieval Europe, archaeologists have explored the illicit burial of unbaptized children in medieval texts and cemeteries.In downtown New York City, archaeologists have exhumed the 18th century remains of the African Burial Ground. When remnants of the WWII Siegfried Line were being destroyed, emergency archaeological digs took place whenever any part of the line was removed, to further scientific knowledge and reveal details of the line's construction.

                        Scientific archaeology views explanation as a logical
                        reductive process. Historicist archaeology, in turn,
                        focuses on what was once known as space–time systematics; this is the locating and explanation of
                        objects in an ordered sequence around the world in
                        different places and times.
                        There are a number of logical means by which
                        archaeologists seek to explain the past. Perhaps the
                        most common is the ethnographic analogy. Ethnographic analogy is based upon the principle that
                        people in similar cultural and environmental circumstances faced with similar goals, resources, and constraints will behave in similar ways. </small>

                <div class="lin9">
                    <small><b><u>Explaining the Past</u></b><br>Ethnographic analogy works with other
                        kinds of human behavior to varying degrees. It is
                        successful to the degree that selective pressures operate on the choices made by people. Where cultural
                        choices, such as language syntax or dress styles, do
                        not alter the fitness of individuals or groups in a
                        selective environment (both social and ecological),
                        then ethnographic analogy is of little or no use.Ethnoarchaeology and experimental archaeology
                        are logically similar to ethnographic analogy (see
                        Ethnoarchaeology; Experimental Archaeology).
                        Ethnoarchaeology studies modern peoples to provide
                        more precise ethnographic analogs to aid in the explanation of past behaviors.<br><br>
                    <b><u>Conclusion</u></b><br>Archaeology is a rich and diverse discipline with
                    theoretical approaches that range from the most
                    humanistic to the most scientific. Archaeology can
                    be practiced as an interpretative narrative, as a historical discipline, or as a comparative social or behavioral science.<br><br>

                Archaeology stimulates interest in ancient objects, and people in search of artifacts or treasure cause damage to archaeological sites. The commercial and academic demand for artifacts unfortunately contributes directly to the illicit antiquities trade. Smuggling of antiquities abroad to private collectors has caused great cultural and economic damage in many countries whose governments lack the resources and or the will to deter it. Looters damage and destroy archaeological sites, denying future generations information about their ethnic and cultural heritage. Indigenous peoples especially lose access to and control over their 'cultural resources', ultimately denying them the opportunity to know their past.
                Some historical archaeology sites are subjected to looting by metal detector hobbyists who search for artifacts using increasingly advanced technology.All forms of archaeological practice that
                are executed well can enrich our understanding of the
                past. Explanation in archaeology takes many forms
                and depends upon the kind of archaeology that is
                practiced. The most explicit use of explanation in
                archaeology is found in the historicist and scientific
                traditions. As such, contemporary archaeology has
                moved well beyond a focus on the object to permit
                us to define meaning and explain past behaviors
