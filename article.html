                hermeneutics An epistemological theory with roots in the
                study of biblical texts that understanding is based on the
                dialectical (back-and-forth) relationship between the whole

                New Archaeology A movement that began in America in the
                1960s, aimed at making archaeology more scientific by
                employing empiricist and neo-positivist principles.
                positivism A philosophy that the only authentic knowledge is
                scientific knowledge, and that such knowledge can only come
                from positive affirmation of theories through strict scientific
                method.
                postprocessualism A school of archaeological thought that
                uses critical theory and interpretative methods while cautioning
                against the shortcomings of scientific archaeology.
                processualism A school of archaeological thought that uses
                empiricist theories of knowledge and scientific methods to derive
                testable models of human behavior.</p></div>

       
            <div class="col-6"><b><u>At the beginning of the twenty-first century</u></b><br><br>
                <p>we canprofitably define four broad kinds of archaeological
                    research based upon their philosophical foundations
                    and the implicit and explicit goals stated by their practitioners. These kinds of archaeology, ranging from
                    the least to the most scientific: are (1) critical theory,(2) hermeneutic or interpretative archaeology, (3) historicist archaeology, and (4) scientific archaeology. In
                    short, contemporary critical theorists seek to create
                    narratives of the past consistent with broad moral
                    and political principles and to examine the discipline
                    of archaeology itself as a constructed social practice.
                    Hermeneutic or interpretative archaeology seeks to
                    read multiple meanings into the archaeological record.
                    Historicist archaeology seeks to explain the archaeological record of objects and archaeological contexts in
                    space and time. Scientific archaeology seeks to subsume the empirical archaeological record into broader
                    principles of human behavior. Each of these kinds of
                    archaeology begins with different logical principles
                    and assumptions. For each kind of archaeology, ‘explanation’ has different meanings, if any meaning at
                    all. Even more complex, many archaeologists adopt
                    the principles of two or more of these intellectual
                    traditions simultaneously as they do their work.
            </div>
            <div class="col-6"><b><u>Throughout</b></u><br><br>
                <p> its 200 years as a recognizable intellectual activity, archaeology has focused on both the
                    recovery of ancient objects and explaining what
                    precisely those objects mean about the societies that
                    produced them. In this sense, ‘explanation’ in archaeology is historically and culturally contingent, and the
                    aims and techniques of archaeological explanation
                    shift as the epistemological and ontological foundations of the discipline shift. The purpose of this entry
                    is to define precisely what explanation in archaeology
                    is in contemporary terms.
                    Explanation is defined by most dictionaries as ‘the
                    act of giving the reason for, the justification of, or the
                    cause of phenomena.’ Historically and linguistically,
                    the terms explanation and cause are associated with
                    scientific approaches in the social, behavioral, and
                    natural sciences. Within contemporary archaeology,
                    however, there are both scientific and nonscientific
                    approaches to studying the past. A proper examination of ‘explanation’ in archaeology therefore
                    requires a broadening of the definition of explanation to include any epistemology that gives meaning
                    to the past as derived from the material record. This
                    entry will therefore be an expansive treatment of
                    the topic to cover both nonscientific and scientific
                    approaches.</p><br>

                <b><u>Idealist Philosophical Traditions</u></b><br>
                Critical archaeology Critical theory practitioners stand at the end of one continuum in the philosophy of social science. Generally antagonistic to modern philosophies of science (logical positivism and empiricism), the core goal of critical theory is not to define what is in the archaeological record, but rather define: (1) what the archaeological record ought to teach us about the past and (2) to deconstruct archaeology as a power-infused social activity and rectify what they see as past errors in the way archaeology has been practiced. Critical theorists begin with the assumption that all knowledge is socially constructed, a tradition drawn largely from philosophical idealism. Furthermore, in this tradition, no socially constructed knowledge base is better or worse than any other by any a priori criteria. As such, critical theorists in archaeology seek explanation of the past in terms of their implications for social action in the present. Explanation, or more appropriately stated, providing meaning to the archaeological record and to the act of explanation itself, is subsumed under broad social, political, cultural precepts, and/or moral mandates.
             </div>
            <div class="col-6"><b><u>Empiricism</u></b><br>the forth, is considered inappropriate
                for archaeological interpretation. Any scientific epistemology assumes that a real and knowable world
                exists apart from the human observers – that is,
                what scientists study is independent of the analytical
                process and has an independent ontological status
                with its own a priori properties. Scientific epistemologies assume that data and history are real, and that
                the process of interpretation, in theory (if not necessarily in practice), can be morally neutral. Scientific
                philosophies eschew the metaphysical. Extreme logical positivism even denied the existence of abstract
                truths not verifiable by the human senses, although
                most archaeological scientists today hold much more
                moderate views as described below.
                Archaeologists working in this critical theory tradition would ideally expect the interpretation of those
                power relationships to contribute to some kind of
                broader social activity that weakens asymmetrical
                relationships of power in contemporary society. Ironically, while maintaining a hyper-relativistic stance as
                an ideal, interpretations of the past that conform to
                morally sound principles of social justice are usually
                considered superior to those that are perceived.

            <b><u>Scientific archaeology</u></b><br>Scientific archaeology accepts many of the principles of historicist archaeology
            but goes further in that the primary goal is to subsume
            the archaeological record into broader patterns of
            human behavior in space and time. Scientific archaeology is viewed by its practitioners as a branch of
            comparative behavioral and social science. As such,
            it is most closely associated with ‘explanation’ and
            ‘causality’, as generally understood in the philosophy
            of science.
            Contemporary scientific archaeology is an outgrowth of the New Archaeology popular in the
            1960s and 1970s. The philosophical standards of
            this perspective can be found in the book Explanation
            in Archaeology by P. Watson, S. Le Blanc, and
            C. Redman (1971). The New Archaeology explicitly
            borrowed from the logical positivism and extreme
            empiricism of the Vienna School and its later practitioners. When the critique of logical positivism
            among philosophers of science in the 1950s and
            1960s gained ground later in archaeology, the New Archaeology modified its epistemological underpinnings. In particular, modifications by the work of the
            philosopher Hempel (in particular, the recognition of
            ‘statistical’ laws) and, to a lesser extent, the influence
            of Popper, contributed to a reformulation that served
            as the philosophical basis of the next generation of
            scientific archaeology that developed out of the New
            Archaeology

            Eliminating some of the excesses of the extreme
            empiricism of logical positivism and adopting more
            ‘elastic’ criteria of verification, scientific archaeology
            has shifted its focus since the 1980s. It is a safe generalization to say that the New Archaeology was largely
            associated with Hempelian deductive-nomological
            explanation, while contemporary scientific archaeology is more associated with Popperian falsification
            epistemologies and instrumentalist philosophies of
            science. Instrumentalist assumptions reject the notion
            that absolute truth can be known and instead rely on
            ‘best fit’ models.the same way that evolutionary biologists construct
            generalizing principles to understand the origin and
            evolution of the world’s plants and animals. Within
            evolutionary biology, there is a wide range of theoretical approaches.Virtually all contemporary scientific neoevolutionary theory rejects the universalizing and totalizing
            features of early unilineal or, to a lesser extent theory.

            <b><u>Explaining the Past</u></b><br>Ethnographic analogy works with other
            kinds of human behavior to varying degrees. It is
            successful to the degree that selective pressures operate on the choices made by people. Where cultural
            choices, such as language syntax or dress styles, do
            not alter the fitness of individuals or groups in a
            selective environment (both social and ecological),
            then ethnographic analogy is of little or no use.Ethnoarchaeology and experimental archaeology
            are logically similar to ethnographic analogy (see
            Ethnoarchaeology; Experimental Archaeology).
            Ethnoarchaeology studies modern peoples to provide
            more precise ethnographic analogs to aid in the explanation of past behaviors.<br><br>
            <b><u>Conclusion</u></b><br>Archaeology is a rich and diverse discipline with
            theoretical approaches that range from the most
            humanistic to the most scientific. Archaeology can
            be practiced as an interpretative narrative, as a historical discipline, or as a comparative social or behavioral science.<br><br>

            Archaeology stimulates interest in ancient objects, and people in search of artifacts or treasure cause damage to archaeological sites. The commercial and academic demand for artifacts unfortunately contributes directly to the illicit antiquities trade. Smuggling of antiquities abroad to private collectors has caused great cultural and economic damage in many countries whose governments lack the resources and or the will to deter it. Looters damage and destroy archaeological sites, denying future generations information about their ethnic and cultural heritage. Indigenous peoples especially lose access to and control over their 'cultural resources', ultimately denying them the opportunity to know their past.
            Some historical archaeology sites are subjected to looting by metal detector hobbyists who search for artifacts using increasingly advanced technology.All forms of archaeological practice that
            are executed well can enrich our understanding of the
            past. Explanation in archaeology takes many forms
            and depends upon the kind of archaeology that is
            practiced. The most explicit use of explanation in
            archaeology is found in the historicist and scientific
            traditions. As such, contemporary archaeology has
            moved well beyond a focus on the object to permit
            us to define meaning and explain past behaviors
            around the world in space and time.
